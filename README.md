# MachineLearning

## Overview

Welcome to the MachineLearning repository! Here, you'll find a treasure trove of Jupyter Notebooks showcasing the implementation of fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch. No shortcuts, no black boxes - just pure, unadulterated code crafted by a passionate learner and practitioner of the art and science of machine learning.

## What's Inside

1. **Linear Regression:** Dive deep into the heart of predictive modeling with our custom implementation of Linear Regression. Understand the core concepts of regression analysis and witness how we build a predictive model step by step.

2. **Naive Bayes:** Explore the elegant simplicity of the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification tasks. We break down the math behind Bayes' theorem and demonstrate how to apply it to real-world data.

3. **Perceptron:** Unravel the mysteries of neural networks by building a Perceptron model from scratch. Learn about activation functions, weight optimization, and the power of single-layer networks.

4. **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):** Get hands-on with the KNN algorithm and understand its intuitive approach to classification. Discover how to find similarities between data points and make predictions based on the nearest neighbors.

5. **Forward Propagation:** Take a journey through the forward pass of a neural network. Witness how input data flows through the network, undergoes transformations, and produces an output.

6. **Back Propagation:** Delve into the backpropagation algorithm, the cornerstone of training neural networks. Learn how to adjust weights and biases to minimize errors and improve model performance.
